Got it ✅ — I see your current README is **almost complete**, but it’s missing a **Streamlit-specific “How to Run” section** and some minor clarity improvements. I’ve polished and completed your README below so it’s fully ready for GitHub:

# 🛡️ PhishFry

Phishing Attack Prevention using **CNN + LSTM Ensemble Model** for URL Classification

---

## 📘 Overview

**PhishFry** is a phishing attack prevention system that uses a **CNN + LSTM ensemble model** to classify URLs as either *legitimate* or *phishing*.  
The project combines **deep learning** and **cybersecurity** concepts to effectively detect malicious links that may attempt to steal user credentials or sensitive data.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Phishing remains one of the most common cyberattacks today.  
Attackers disguise malicious websites as trustworthy ones to deceive users into revealing confidential information such as passwords, credit card details, or personal data.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

PhishFry leverages:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** — for extracting local URL feature patterns  
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** — for learning sequential URL characteristics  
- **Ensemble Learning** — to combine CNN and LSTM predictions for improved accuracy  

This hybrid model achieves strong generalization in detecting phishing URLs.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

1. **Input:** URL text sequence  
2. **Embedding Layer:** Converts tokens into dense vectors  
3. **CNN Layer:** Extracts spatial/local patterns  
4. **LSTM Layer:** Captures sequential dependencies  
5. **Dense + Sigmoid Layer:** Outputs phishing or legitimate classification

| Metric | Score |
|:-------:|:------:|
| Accuracy | **99.75%** |
| Precision | **~1.00** |
| Recall | **~1.00** |
| F1-Score | **~1.00** |

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmallwonderRania/PhishFry.git
cd PhishFry
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

The dataset can be accessed from Google Drive:
👉 [PhishFry Dataset (Download Link)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15nsZsMRdTme2K_-QBxrenhnMXkuMRXbg/view?usp=sharing)

Place the downloaded dataset file inside the `dataset/` folder.

## ▶️ How to Run PhishFry (Streamlit App)

### 1. Launch the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* The app will open in your default browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
* You can **enter any URL** in the input box to check if it’s **legitimate** or **phishing**.

### 2. Notes

* The app automatically loads the trained model from the `models/` folder.
* Ensure the dataset is in the `dataset/` folder if the app uses it.
* All dependencies must be installed via `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Streamlit** (for deployment)

---

## 🚀 Future Work

* Deploy as a **web service** or **browser extension** for real-time phishing detection
* Improve model generalization with **more diverse datasets**
* Explore **Transformer-based architectures** (like BERT) for phishing URL detection
* Integrate with **cybersecurity dashboards** for enterprise monitoring
