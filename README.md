Phishing attack prevention using CNN + LSTM ensemble model for URL classification
# PhishFry

PhishFry is a **phishing attack prevention system** that uses a **CNN + LSTM ensemble model** to classify URLs as legitimate or phishing.  
This project combines **deep learning** with practical application to strengthen cybersecurity against online threats.

## üöÄ Overview
Phishing is one of the most common cyberattacks, where malicious websites trick users into sharing sensitive data.  
PhishFry leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for feature extraction and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for sequence learning to accurately classify URLs.  

**Key highlights:**
- End-to-end phishing detection pipeline  
- Hybrid deep learning model (CNN + LSTM)  
- Jupyter notebook for training & experiments  
- Flask/Streamlit-based app (`app.py`) for easy use
